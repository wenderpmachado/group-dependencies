# group-dependencies
![Node.js CI](https://github.com/itsthatguy/group-dependencies/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/group-dependencies.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/group-dependencies)

## What


**npm** gives you two groups to specify dependencies (i.e. dev and prod).
In the real world, we have multiple dependency environments (e.g. test, build,
production, development).

Letâ€™s say you run webpack on heroku to build your app. There are 2 options:
1. Set `heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false` to install all dependencies (including testing dependencies)
2. Put your build dependencies in `dependencies` (i.e. production environment)

With group-dependencies, you can declare your build dependencies in a separate
property, `buildDependencies`, and install only those packages as needed, by
adding to `"scripts": { "heroku-postbuild": deps install build" }`
to your `package.json`.

## Installation

```
npm install group-dependencies
```

## Usage

First, add a new dependencies group to `package.json`:
```js
{
  ...
  "devDependencies": {
    "intercept-stdout": "^0.1.2",
    "jest": "^20.0.4",
    "strip-color": "^0.1.0"
  },
  // our new group representing testing dependencies
  "testDependencies": [
    "jest"
  ]
  ...
}
```

Now you can install _only_ the dependencies for this new group:

```shell
# This will install jest@^20.0.4:
deps install test
```

### Command
```shell
# Install dependencies in the named group
deps install [GROUP_NAME]
```

### How it works

Any item added to the `[GROUP_NAME]Dependencies` property will be installed with
`deps install [GROUP_NAME]`. If a matching package is found in `devDependencies`,
that version will be installed.

```js
// Here's the part that matters.
"buildDependencies": [
  "webpack",
  "@babel/preset-env"
]
```

The decision to use this strategy, with an array, was made so that we can
leverage a few things.
1. In your development enviroment, let `npm` manage installing your dev dependencies.
2. You only need to manage package versions in one location, reducing the overhead.
